# Symplique_Remind_Me_Later_Django_API_Endpoint
# Full Stack Developer Internship Assessment Assignment

Project: Remind-me-later

This web app does one thing and one thing well. It allows users to setup a reminder with a message. The JS developers have gone ahead and created a nice UI to accept date and time, to know when to send the message, and the actual text message to send. They have also given an option to select how to remind. Right now the app support reminding through SMS and Email. Going forward the app might support other ways to send the reminder.

JS devs need an API to call to save the state to the db. Design and implement an API endpoint using django for the above requirement.
